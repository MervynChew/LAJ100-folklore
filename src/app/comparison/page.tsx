            Japanese folklore really got a lot of special creatures. Some are very old stories, some are more modern ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the traditional ones, many creatures became famous during the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868). Last time got this artist called Toriyama Sekien, he draw and collect a lot of these creatures in books, so now people know more about them.
          </p>

          <p>
            They call these creatures Y≈çkai (Â¶ñÊÄ™) ‚Äî some got power, some just not normal human. Not all Y≈çkai are bad, some are just playful, or even helpful. For example, Tengu ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a mountain creature with long nose or bird face, sometimes will help people, not really evil.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside Y≈çkai, got one group called Y≈´rei (ÂπΩÈúä) ‚Äî this one is ghost. Mostly are people who die but still got problem or very sad, so they never leave this world. If the ghost really angry and want revenge, then they become Onry≈ç (ÊÄ®Èúä). One example is Oiwa-san, she die because her husband treat her very badly, so she become one very vengeful spirit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Got modern stories also. One very famous is Kuchisake-onna, the ‚ÄúSlit-Mouth Woman‚Äù. This story become popular in 1978‚Äì1979. She will come and ask you ‚ÄúAm I pretty?‚Äù but no matter how you answer, she might still hurt you. Very scary, especially imagine meeting her at night!
          </p>

        <section className={styles.subtitle}>
          Malaysian Folklore
        </section>

        <section className={styles.content}>
          <p>
            Malaysian ghost stories are also no joke. Most of them are dangerous to people. The ghost always wants to scare or hurt humans.
          </p>

            alt="Ghostly figure"
            width={600}
            height={400}
            className={styles.image}
          />

          <p>
            One of the most famous is Pontianak. She is a woman who dies during giving birth, then becomes a ghost to take revenge. She attacks men, sometimes children or women also. She can appear very pretty, but once you see her real face, confirm you run.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another one is Pocong. It‚Äôs a ghost that still tie up in kain kafan (funeral cloth). The story say that if the cloth never untie properly, the soul cannot rest. So they hop around and scare people. This one also got link to Islamic tradition.
          </p>

          <p>
            So can say Malaysian ghost stories mostly focus on angry spirits and things not done properly after death.
