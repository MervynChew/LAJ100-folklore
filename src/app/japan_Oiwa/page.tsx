    title: 'üå∏ Once in Edo...',
    text: `A long time ago in Edo period, in Japan, there lived a woman named Oiwa. She was married to a samurai named Tamiya Iemon, but their marriage was full of pain and sadness. Iemon was not a good man. He was selfish, greedy, and even killed Oiwa‚Äôs father when Oiwa‚Äôs father discovered Iemon‚Äôs misconduct and tried to expose him, Iemon murdered him, yet pretended to mourn in order to keep Oiwa unaware. Oiwa didn‚Äôt know this, and she had no choice but to stay with Iemon.`,

    title: 'üíî A Hard Life and a Cruel Plan',
    text: `After some time, Oiwa gave birth to a son. Life was very hard for them, and they were very poor. Iemon began to hate Oiwa and wanted to leave her. One day, he met a young woman named Oume, the granddaughter of a rich doctor. Oume liked Iemon and wanted to marry him. The doctor supported this and devised a cruel plan‚Äîhe gave Oiwa an ointment under the pretense of medicine, but it actually horribly disfigured her face.

    When Oiwa put it on her face, it became horribly disfigured (twisted and ugly). Iemon was disgusted by her looks. To get rid of Oiwa, Iemon paid a man to rape Oiwa, hoping to use it as grounds for divorce.

    But the plan didn‚Äôt go as expected. The man Iemon hired was horrified by Oiwa's appearance and starting to feel sorry for Oiwa. He showed her a mirror. When Oiwa saw her reflection in a mirror, she let out a strangled cry and, in despair and rage, stabbed her own throat with a sword.
    
    But her death was only the beginning.`,

    text: `To cover his crimes, Iemon killed a servant named Kobotoke Kohei, falsely accusing him of being Oiwa‚Äôs lover. He nailed both corpses to a wooden panel and threw it into the river to make it appear they committed a double suicide. Meanwhile, Iemon proceeded to marry Oume.`,

    text: `On the night Iemon married Oume, he saw Oiwa‚Äôs ghost instead of Oume. He thought it was Oiwa and stabbed her, but when he looked again, he had actually killed Oume by mistake. Then, he saw Oiwa‚Äôs ghost again and killed Oume‚Äôs grandfather. From that moment on, Oiwa‚Äôs spirit haunted him wherever he went.
    
    He couldn‚Äôt escape. Her face would appear in lights, in mirrors, in dreams ‚Äî always watching him. He kept trying to run, but her spirit followed him. `,
